 *
 * Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.
 * 
 * To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which
 * represents the position (0-indexed)Â in the linked list where tail connects
 * to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the
 * second node.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the
 * first node.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [1], pos = -1
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * 
 * Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?
